# LOG

Sculpt log. The **Current state** block is rewritten at the end of every session. Session entries are prepended, so the newest is first. Workflow: CLAUDE.md.

## Current state

**Stage:** 0 — Armature (in progress: exit criteria 3 of 5 met)
**Last session:** S4 · 2026-09-29
**Works:**
- A pnpm monorepo with `sim`, `content`, `tools` and `client` packages, strict TS 6.0, no build step.
- `pnpm check` is green: typecheck, lint, 78 tests.
- ESLint enforces the sim's hard rules (imports, Math/Date/timers, async, classes, `**`, float literals), in sim tests too.
- Sim: `createMatch({ seed, rules })`, pure `step(state, commands)` at a fixed tick, sfc32 RNG in state, `hashState` (FNV-1a over canonical JSON). Commands are validated; with hands still empty, every one is rejected and recorded.
- Match timer and result: 3:00 regulation, then up to 2:00 overtime while stars are tied; any star lead after regulation wins, still tied at the end is a draw. Stepping an ended match throws.
- `checkInvariants(state)` (tick range, timer → result, rng words, stars, result vs stars).
- `content` exports `MATCH_RULES`; `pnpm sim match --seed <n> [--dump <tick>]` plays an empty match to a draw at tick 6000 with invariants checked every tick.
- `content` exports `ARENA` (D7): 18 × 32 tiles, a 2-tile river, one 3-wide bridge per lane, and a 4×4 Keep plus two 3×3 Outposts per side. Side 1 is built as side 0 mirrored across the river. An ASCII map test pins it. The sim doesn't read it yet.
**Known issues:**
- No formatter configured yet (the code follows the existing style by convention).
- Nothing earns stars yet (no towers); the end-of-match scenarios set stars directly.
**Golden replays:** none (the RNG sequence is pinned in `rng-sequence-is-fixed-per-seed.test.ts`)

**Next cuts** (in order):
1. Client skeleton: Vite + PixiJS v8 draws `ARENA` (tiles, river, bridges, towers as shapes) with side 0 at the bottom. Look up the PixiJS v8 and Vite docs via Context7 first.
2. `pnpm shots`: Playwright opens the client and saves a PNG (closes Stage 0's criterion 4). It may fit in the same session as 1.
3. Replay format v0 with a save/load round-trip test; zod-validate commands loaded from outside (the sim trusts `Command` field types). `pnpm sim match` then saves one.
4. Stage 1, when towers become sim entities: pass `ARENA`'s tower sites to the sim through `MatchSetup` (D7).

## Sessions

### S4 · 2026-09-29 · Arena layout in content
**Stage:** 0 — Armature
**Cut:** Put the arena layout in `content` as data, as the director decided, so the client has something to draw next.
**Done:**
- `content/src/arena.ts`: `ArenaLayout`, `Rect`, `Bridge`, `Lane`, `TowerSite`, and `ARENA`, written in tiles via a `tiles()` helper that refuses fractional milli-tiles.
- VISION.md: Stage 0 now says "from the arena layout in `content`", and D7 is added (the director approved in chat).
**Verified:** `pnpm check` green (15 files, 78 tests). An ASCII map test renders one character per tile. Property tests cover integer measurements, a full-width river at the middle, one bridge per lane spanning it, the Keep at back center, one Outpost per lane, mirror symmetry, towers on whole tiles on their own half, and no overlaps. 4 layout mutations were each caught.
**Decisions:** D7. Side 0 holds the low-y half (as S2's test commands already assumed). The layout types live in `content` for now: the sim will define what it needs when it consumes the layout.
**Left out / noticed:** Deploy zones and their extension, tower stats, and passing the layout into the sim are left for Stage 1+ (Next cuts 4).
**Status:** complete

### S3 · 2026-09-29 · Match timer and result
**Stage:** 0 — Armature
**Cut:** Give the match an end (a timer, overtime and a result) with the length coming from `content`, and add `pnpm sim match` to play one headless.
**Done:**
- Sim: `MatchRules` in `MatchSetup` and state, `stars`, `result`, `decideResult`, `checkInvariants`. Sim tests share a `fixtures.ts`.
- Content: `MATCH_RULES` (3600 + 2400 ticks). Tools: `runMatch`, `describeResult`, and the `match` command with `--seed` and `--dump`.
**Verified:** `pnpm check` green (13 files, 69 tests). Scenario tests: more stars at 3:00 wins on that tick, a lead mid-regulation doesn't end it, tied → overtime, first overtime star wins, tied at the end → draw, zero overtime, stepping an ended match throws, bad rules rejected. Each invariant is shown to fire. The CLI prints the same hash in separate processes (seed 42 → `330933a4`). 6 hand mutations (off-by-one end, no overtime, wrong winner, …) were each caught.
**Decisions:** The rules live in the state, so `step(state, commands)` keeps its signature and the hash covers them. Stepping an ended match throws instead of silently doing nothing. One rule covers both ways to win on stars: after regulation, any star lead wins. The tower-HP tiebreak waits for towers, so for now tied stars are always a draw. Content writes times as `seconds * TICKS_PER_SECOND`.
**Left out / noticed:** The question of where the arena lives (content or sim) went into Next cuts. There's no bot yet, so the "bot-vs-bot with invariants" check ran as an empty match.
**Status:** complete

### S2 · 2026-09-29 · Sim skeleton
**Stage:** 0 — Armature
**Cut:** Give the sim its state, seeded RNG, fixed tick and state hash, and prove that the same seed and commands reproduce the same hash at tick 1000.
**Done:**
- `rng.ts` (sfc32, seeded as PractRand does), `hash.ts` (canonical JSON + FNV-1a), `state.ts` (`SimState`, `Command`, `createMatch`, `hashState`), `step.ts`.
- 5 scenario test files: determinism to tick 1000, JSON round-trip and resume, no input mutation (deep-frozen), canonical hash and FNV vectors, RNG golden sequence, command rejection and side order.
**Verified:** `pnpm check` green (9 files, 37 tests). sfc32 cross-checked against an independent Python implementation on 4 seeds. Mutation check: sharing `rng` between states and dropping the side sort each failed one test. Found a mismatch: LOG said S1 was complete, but git had no commits because no identity is configured.
**Decisions:** `step` builds a fresh state and never mutates its inputs, so the client can keep the previous tick for interpolation. Canonical JSON throws on floats, `undefined`, Maps and class instances, so the "plain JSON, integers only" rule fails loudly. `state.rejected` holds only the last step's rejections, because the replay already holds every command. Commands resolve side 0 first; order within a side is kept. Git author is set repo-local to `Narcis13`; S1 was committed first on its own.
**Left out / noticed:** Match timer and result, arena constants, invariants and bot matches (no match exists to run yet) are in Next cuts. How content numbers reach the sim (through `MatchSetup`) is settled in the next cut.
**Status:** complete

### S1 · 2026-09-29 · Scaffold the monorepo
**Stage:** 0 — Armature
**Cut:** Give every later cut somewhere to live and a definition of green.
**Done:**
- Ran `git init` (branch `main`); pnpm 11 workspace with `packages/{sim,content,tools,client}`, each exporting `./src/index.ts`.
- `tsconfig.base.json`: strict, `nodenext`, `erasableSyntaxOnly`, `.ts` imports. The sim and content packages get no DOM or Node types.
- `eslint.config.js`: `strictTypeChecked` plus sim-only guardrails for determinism and imports.
- Vitest 5 with each package as a project; smoke tests prove workspace resolution and that Node runs the CLI's `.ts` directly.
**Verified:** `pnpm check` green (4 files, 5 tests). Linted a throwaway file of sim violations: all 13 were caught; file removed. Ran `pnpm sim` (exit 0) and `pnpm sim nope` (exit 1).
**Decisions:** TypeScript pinned to `~6.0` because typescript-eslint 8 supports only TS below 6.1, and 7.0 is the latest. No build step; Node 24 strips types natively.
**Left out / noticed:** Prettier and other formatters (Known issues). The `bot` package gets created in Stage 1, when it's needed. pnpm 12 is available; we stay on 11.0.8, which is pinned via `packageManager`.
**Status:** complete

### S0 · 2026-09-29 · Vision and workflow
**Stage:** pre-0
**Cut:** Set the foundation before any code: what we build, and how each session works.
**Done:**
- VISION.md: product, rules spec, architecture, the agent's senses, quality bar, stages 0–5, decisions D1–D6.
- CLAUDE.md: the sculpt coding session loop; VISION.md is imported so it's always in context.
- LOG.md: this file.
**Verified:** n/a (docs only).
**Decisions:** D1–D6 (see VISION.md §10).
**Left out / noticed:** The open questions in VISION.md §11 (title, art direction, target device, PvP in v1) are waiting on the director.
**Status:** complete
